# Diabetes-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project developed using Super Vector Machine Algorithm to predict whether a person is diabetic or not. 
The dataset "Diabetes" consists of information about symptoms of  people who are suffering from diabetes  and who are not affected.
The dataset is read using Pandas and the data is  given for training and testing through the Support Vector Machine Algorithm.
After the model is trained a new input is given to test whether the person is diabetic or not.
By using this Support Vector Machine Algorithm the model predicts where the person is diabetic or not.
